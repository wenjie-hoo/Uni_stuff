/*
Create three data sets of different types in your program vector<double>, list<string> and set<int>. 
Fill these containers with random values (you can randomly or arbitrarily type something). 
Then perform some calculations on these sets using the functors you have defined:
- Print all values in the given range (greater than a and less than b).
- Output every kth value starting from the p-th position.
- Determine the arithmetic mean (applies to collections with numbers).
- Determine the minimum and maximum element (return a pair of values).
- Determine the sum (or concatenation for character strings) of all elements.
For each task, define a function object (with internal state) and use it in a for-each loop. When programming this task, 
do not use accumulate() or similar functions.
